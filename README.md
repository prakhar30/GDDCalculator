# GDD Calculator
A simple iOS app to calculate the Growing Degree Days between two input dates and show the results in the form of beautiful charts.

#### Tech
The app is implemented in Swift 2, and xCode 7.2. Also, the famous Charts-iOS library is used to create charts of the output.

Simply clone or download the project and open it in xCode 7, Swift 2 to run the application.

It is one of my first projects in iOS, so everybody will not agree upon the architecture and code quality but I was successful in getting the results that I wanted. Any feedbacks or suggestion for improvements are welcome. :)
